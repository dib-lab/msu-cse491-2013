JavaScript and JQuery
=====================

JavaScript (/ECMAScript): http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript

JavaScript is an in-browser programming language designed to provide
customization of interactive behavior and reduce real or apparent
user-interface latency (e.g. avoid up-front server round trips -- see
AJAX, below).

JQuery examples
---------------

Since JavaScript is one of the worst possible languages actually in
wide use (it's needlessly inconsistent and largely incoherent) a number
of frameworks have popped into existence to help programmers actually
make effective use of it.

JQuery (http://jquery.org/) is one such framework; it's relatively small,
fast, and concise.

JQuery uses two nice basic concepts: *selectors*, and *chaining*.  Selectors
let you pick out sets or subsets of elements based on CSS-style patterns:

Chaining lets you apply multiple functions in sequence without respecifying
which elements you want to modify:

You can specify all sorts of fun tricks:
