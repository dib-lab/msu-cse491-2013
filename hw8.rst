==========
Homework 8
==========

**Not yet complete; I will send an e-mail when it's posted.**

Due by noon on Thursday, Mar 20th.

0. Merge hw7 into your master.  Please don't delete the 'hw7' branch.

   Hand in this homework on branch 'hw8' on your github account, and
   set up a pull request between hw8 and your master branch.  Don't merge
   it, just set up the PR.

1. Implement command line options in server.py to run the following WSGI apps:

      imageapp
      quixote.demo.altdemo
      your app through hw6.

   (Details go here.)

2. Run the twill tests for each of the three.  The 'imageapp' and
   'altdemo' tests should run without modification. Feel free to fix
   the links to test your app.

   (Details go here.)

3. Pick 5 points worth of projects from :doc:`projects` and implement.

   (Details go here.)

   As per the syllabus, you are allowed to work collaboratively but
   everything you hand in must have your own name on the commits.  The
   only exception to this is if you are working with someone else's
   hw8 project, but the sum of the project points must be N*5 (if you
   work in a group with N=2 people, each person must implement 5 pts
   worth of projects).  Note that you are also responsible for making
   sure the other persons' code doesn't break your code.

----

Do a clean checkout of your repo and make sure that all the tests pass
and that all your functionality works on the clean checkout, on arctic.

Using ChangeLog, please explain your project choice and implementation
in sufficient detail to let someone else (me) who is _not_ psychic
understand what you've done and run it.  Test these instructions using
a clean checkout.  I mean it.

.. make sure I can run their server; command line options!!
.. cookie tests!!
.. twill tests on their wsgi server
