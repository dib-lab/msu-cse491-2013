Welcome to the Web Dev class (2014)
===================================

Lecture/lab: Tu/Th 3-4:20pm, 55 Union Bldg

Instructor: C. Titus Brown, ctb@msu.edu, BPS 2228(c)

TA: Leigh Sheneman, leighs@msu.edu, BPS 2228.

Office hours will be in 3353 Egr at 9pm on Wednesday evenings, unless
otherwise stated.

**Objectives:**

In this course, you will learn how the Web works by working on an HTTP
server, a backend Web app (including database and HTML generation),
and a front-end JavaScript interface. As part of this we will discuss
concepts in client-server and peer-to-peer architectures and how all
of this technology works “under the hood” on today’s Internet.  We'll
also discuss issues and approaches to developing software with an eye
to maintainability, and learn about the practical separation of
concerns in Web application stacks, from browser through server. A key
part of this course will be the use of git and github. This course
will be programming intensive and you should expect to either know
Python or be prepared to learn it fairly well on your own.
