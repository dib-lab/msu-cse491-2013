===============================

0. Read `A conspiracy of hogs
<http://www.theawl.com/2011/11/a-conspiracy-of-hogs-the-mcrib-as-arbitrage>`__
and skim the Wikipedia entry on `Prediction market
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction_market>`__.

1. `Quizlet <https://docs.google.com/a/msu.edu/forms/d/1BlxqGJj5x_iLTGbg-0p1ivLIkxZLh9S_THvzLpYrgZw/viewform>`__.  You may need to sign into your MSU account on Google first.

2. Discussion.

3. More query diagrams: redirects, and JavaScript.

4. Quick discussion of `twill <http://twill.idyll.org>`__.

   (Note: is anyone interested in rewriting this using 'requests'?)

5. `twill exercise <https://docs.google.com/a/msu.edu/forms/d/1JOzet4UlZ58GyLbi1dXXqBj_iN9ReYrWQi9hzZR2GKc/viewform>`__

   ...AND/OR...

6. write a `query diagram <https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1RIbnuczTYxYB5JLg0oCXz8VlxXpGoBFh4QRb7QI7zQ4/edit#slide=id.p13>`__ for the quotes app.

   To get the quotes app, do a clean checkout of my serverz repo into the directory 'day19' by doing::

     git clone https://github.com/ctb/cse491-serverz.git day19 -b day19

   and then::

     cd day19/quotes/
     python2.7 quotes-server <port number>

   You probably won't need to be in an activate virtualenv to do this.

   Finally, go to::

     arctic.cse.msu.edu:<port number>/quotes-2.html


   Draw a query diagram explaining the HTTP serving that's going on here,
   and then write your NetID on the piece of paper and put 'em in a stack on
   Table 6.
