================================

0. Read `the wikipedia entry on Technical Debt <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt>`__.

   Ancillary readings:

      http://martinfowler.com/bliki/TechnicalDebt.html

      http://blog.codinghorror.com/paying-down-your-technical-debt/

      http://www.construx.com/10x_Software_Development/Technical_Debt/

1. `Quizlet <https://docs.google.com/a/msu.edu/forms/d/1FsZ2NxHWEJ51rAsG89torSfCYuMmx6ULsbg_5ba6RjI/viewform>`__. Please fill this out even if you haven't done the reading.

2. Discussion of technical debt.

3. `Query diagrams intro. <https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1RIbnuczTYxYB5JLg0oCXz8VlxXpGoBFh4QRb7QI7zQ4/edit#slide=id.p13>`__.

4. Make query diagrams for three queries on the 'run-imageapp.py'
   server in my repo, under branch day18; specifically, '/image',
   '/upload', and '/upload2'.  Include the process of actually
   uploading a file via /upload2. (note the 'imageapp' directory
   contains two png files that you can upload).
   
   Note: you can do a clean checkout into the directory 'day18' by doing::

     git clone https://github.com/ctb/cse491-serverz.git day18 -b day18

   and run it with 'run-imageapp.py'.

   Also note: these are example solutions for the JavaScript stuff in
   :doc:`day16`.

   In class, draw three diagrams on a piece of paper or with a graphics
   program, put your NetID on the top of one page, and hand them in
   via e-mail or (*gasp*) by hand. Feel free to work in groups of 2-3;
   just include all y'all's NetID.

   Last note - you can track requests by looking at your running imageapp
   server output.  (Ignore the favicon.ico request.)

5. Brief going over of :doc:`hw8`.
