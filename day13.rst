An actual WSGI application
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Activate your virtualenv, or create/recreate it (see :doc:`virtualenv`).

then, install Quixote into your virtualenv::

   pip install http://quixote.ca/releases/Quixote-2.8.tar.gz

and, finally, try running one of the Quixote demo applications in your
own WSGI server; see
https://github.com/ctb/cse491-serverz/blob/hw5-wsgi/run-qx.py for code
to create the WSGI app.

As an example, I've adapted `eunbong's server code <https://github.com/eunbong/cse491-serverz>`__ to run the Quixote app.  See `the commit and diff <https://github.com/ctb/cse491-serverz/commit/70bea8e700a7f54c53cb2a7110543f9dcfe3ff50>`__ for details on what I did -- it didn't take much.
